## üîß **How to Use Custom Prompts**

### **Method 1: Use Existing Custom Prompts**
```python
from deepseek_llm import DeepSeekLLMService

# Initialize service
llm_service = DeepSeekLLMService()

# Process query with custom prompt (automatically selected based on query type)
response = llm_service.process_query_with_custom_prompt(
    query="What is the medical bill coverage?",
    policy_documents=relevant_docs
)
```

### **Method 2: Add Your Own Custom Query Types**
```python
# Add a new custom query type with your own prompt
llm_service.add_custom_query_type(
    query_type="bonus_policy",
    patterns=[r"bonus", r"incentive", r"reward"],
    prompt_example="""You are an expert in KFG bonus and incentive policy analysis.

Your task is to generate a bonus policy response based on the provided documents.

The response must include:
1. **Bonus Policy Title**: Use exact terms from documents
2. **Bonus Types**: List all bonus categories mentioned
3. **Eligibility**: Who qualifies for bonuses
4. **Calculation**: How bonuses are calculated
5. **Payment Terms**: When and how bonuses are paid
6. **Source Documents**: Reference the documents used

Use only information explicitly stated in the documents.""",
    answer_template={
        "structure": "bonus_policy",
        "required_sections": ["title", "types", "eligibility", "calculation", "payment", "sources"],
        "format": "structured_list"
    }
)
```

### **Method 3: Get Custom Prompt for Specific Query Type**
```python
# Get the custom prompt being used for a query type
custom_prompt = llm_service.get_custom_prompt_for_query_type("medical")
print(f"Medical policy prompt: {custom_prompt[:200]}...")
```

### **Method 4: List All Available Query Types**
```python
# See what query types are available
query_types = llm_service.list_available_query_types()
for qt in query_types:
    print(f"‚Ä¢ {qt}")

# Get detailed info about a specific type
medical_info = llm_service.get_query_type_info("medical")
print(f"Patterns: {medical_info['patterns']}")
print(f"Prompt length: {len(medical_info['prompt_example'])} characters")
